                    <p>This website is an email-themed personal website. The theme is inspired by a front-end coding challenge I got when I first started learning web development – I wasn’t skilled enough to complete the assignment back then, but now I can!</p>
                    <p>The three most significant features of this website:</p>
                    <p>1.) The main window for the email dynamically changes size (implemented using $(window).resize). This lets the email expand to fit different screen sizes, and it also scales with the web browser when it is resized.</p>
                    <p>2.) Clicking 3 different emails will make different emails pop up on the screen. Clicking the collapse button on the top left of the screen, in the nav bar, cycles between 3 different screen layouts. These two things were both done using the jquery 
                        .show and .hide commands along with .css to modify the positioning. Notice the main email window expands to fill the empty space when a menu is collapsed.</p>
                    <p>3.) Small pseudo-selector/clicking stuff. Hovering over the collapse button, the different inboxes, and different emails produces different shadows/borders/cursor effects. Clicking an inbox will make that inbox change to blue font and also produces 
                        a border to the left. Unfortunately I haven’t implemented the inbox filtering functionality yet.</p>

                <div class="message"><p>Dustin Matthew Chen was born on July 14, 1999. He lived in China for 2 years, then on the outskirts of the city of Aurora, before moving
                    a few miles away into the city of Naperville, where he spent his formative years.</p>
                    <p>Ok it got kinda annoying speaking about myself in 3rd person. I went to Neuqua Valley High School, I did pretty well in school, took a lot of AP classes, and was involved in several
                        extracurricular activities. Most important among these was orchestra and ultimate frisbee. Video games were also a big part of my life.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Now I'm at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm studying Computer Science (and maybe something Applied Math related). My hobbies have come and gone - I continued playing frisbee up until this semester,
                        but now I'm just playing intramural volleyball. I'm part of a dance organization called AFX, which has kinda replaced orchestra.
